# Prompt file for Z Shell (zsh)

## Installation

Clone this repository and copy the aliases file with `cp zsh_prompt ~/.zsh_prompt` after words source the newly generated file to your `.zshrc` file.

To Automate this process you can simply run `sudo zsh install.zsh` from an administrator account. Remember to manually create .zshrc file with `nano .zshrc` in `~` beforehand if there is no such file yet. Also remember to that from all accounts that should support the new prompt. (admin icon will only show if the prompt is installed for the admin account aswell.)
